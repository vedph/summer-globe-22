    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      A globe is a spherical model of Earth, of some other celestial body, or of
      the celestial sphere. Globes serve purposes similar to some maps, but
      unlike maps, do not distort the surface that they portray except to scale
      it down. A model globe of Earth is called a terrestrial globe. A model
      globe of the celestial sphere is called a celestial globe.

      A globe shows details of its subject. A terrestrial globe shows landmasses
      and water bodies. It might show nations and major cities and the network
      of latitude and longitude lines. Some have raised relief to show mountains
      and other large landforms. A celestial globe shows notable stars, and may
      also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects. Typically, it
      will also divide the celestial sphere into constellations.

      The word globe comes from the Latin word globus, meaning "sphere". Globes
      have a long history. The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo,
      describing the Globe of Crates from about 150 BC. The oldest surviving
      terrestrial globe is the Erdapfel, wrought by Martin Behaim in 1492. The
      oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the Farnese Atlas, carved in
      the 2nd century Roman Empire.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The sphericity of the Earth was established by Greek astronomy in the 3rd
      century BC, and the earliest terrestrial globe appeared from that period.
      The earliest known example is the one constructed by

        >Crates of Mallus</a
      >
      in <a href="t:http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cilicia">Cilicia</a> (now
      Çukurova in modern-day Turkey), in the mid-2nd century BC.
    </p>
    <p>
      No terrestrial globes from Antiquity or the Middle Ages have survived. An
      example of a surviving celestial globe is part of a Hellenistic sculpture,
      called the Farnese Atlas, surviving in a 2nd-century AD Roman copy in the
      <a href="t:http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples">Naples</a> Archaeological
      Museum, Italy.

      Early terrestrial globes depicting the entirety of the Old World were
      constructed in the Islamic world. According to David Woodward, one such
      example was the terrestrial globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian
      astronomer, Jamal ad-Din, in 1267.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest extant terrestrial globe was made in 1492 by Martin Behaim
      (1459–1537) with help from the painter Georg Glockendon. Behaim was a
      German mapmaker, navigator, and merchant. Working in Nuremberg, Germany,
      he called his globe the "Nürnberg Terrestrial Globe." It is now known as
      the Erdapfel. Before constructing the globe, Behaim had traveled
      extensively. He sojourned in Lisbon from 1480, developing commercial
      interests and mingling with explorers and scientists. He began to
      construct his globe after his return to Nürnberg in 1490.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another early globe, the Hunt–Lenox Globe, ca. 1510, is thought to be the
      source of the phrase Hic Sunt Dracones, or “Here be dragons”. A similar
      grapefruit-sized globe made from two halves of an ostrich egg was found in
      2012 and is believed to date from 1504. It may be the oldest globe to show
      the New World. Stefaan Missine, who analyzed the globe for the Washington
      Map Society journal Portolan, said it was “part of an important European
      collection for decades.” After a year of research in which he consulted
      many experts, Missine concluded the Hunt–Lenox Globe was a copper cast of
      the egg globe.

      A facsimile globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in
      1507. Another "remarkably modern-looking" terrestrial globe of the Earth
      was constructed by Taqi al-Din at the
      <a href="t:http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</a>
      Observatory of Taqi ad-Din during the 1570s.

      In the 1800s small pocket globes (less than 3 inches) were status symbols
      for gentlemen and educational toys for rich children.
